# Events

Making the events.yaml file seperate from the main wiki + tools to maintain it

## Tool plans

* scrapping all known events sites / twitters / facebook pages to get notifications on what's comming up.
* maybe issue processing scripts so we don't have to manually add them
* code to auto trigger a rebuild of the main wiki when this gets updated (i.e how hexbin used to trigger updates)
